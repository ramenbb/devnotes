## How do you prevent other people from pushing to your main repository without your permission?

By default, there is no limit to the number of branches and tags that can be updated in a single push.

You can limit the number of branches and tags that can be updated in a single push to block potentially destructive pushes. This can prevent or limit the loss of data.

You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.

access to repositories is managed by permissions

We can clone or fork any public GitHub repo. This will create a local copy of the repo and it’s files. We can edit these files and push the changes back to GitHub. If you aren’t the owner of the repo, you will need to make a ‘pull request’. This alerts the owner that you’ve made changes to the repo. **The owner can decide which changes they want to ‘merge’ into the repo or they can reject the ‘pull request’.**
