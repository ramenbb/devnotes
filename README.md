- Got re-started on my coding journey. I did the introductory Github course. This seems like a useful tool to manage versions - kind of like iManage but for coding. I did some reading on why there's no such thing like this for contracts in Biglaw - more of resistance to different UIs and it's just not optimized for that. Word is the best fit for that application.
- I also started taking notes in Github.
- Trying to start the game project from python bootcamp book.
