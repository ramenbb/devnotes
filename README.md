- Got re-started on my coding journey. I did the introductory Github course. This seems like a useful tool to manage versions - kind of like iManage but for coding. I did some reading on why there's no such thing like this for contracts in Biglaw - more of resistance to different UIs and it's just not optimized for that. Word is the best fit for that application.
- I also started taking notes in Github.
- Trying to start the game project from python bootcamp book.

- Not much time today so going to try to make the best of an hour and a half. I am quite excited about Godot whereas python game dev has felt quite tedious and manual. My goal is to get through the alien invasion game by the end of this week and start with the API work by the end of this week too.
